# javascriptcore-sys

These are raw bindings for the JavaScriptCore library.

This only works on macOS and Linux for now, but should be
possible to use elsewhere once linking to the correct
libraries has been configured.

## Support and Maintenance

I am developing this library largely on my own so far. I am able
to offer support and maintenance, but would very much appreciate
donations via [Patreon](https://patreon.com/endoli). I can also
provide commercial support, so feel free to
[contact me](mailto:bruce.mitchener@gmail.com).
